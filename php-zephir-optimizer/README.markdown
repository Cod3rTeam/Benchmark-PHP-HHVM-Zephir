Zephir with Optimizer
=====================

This is the Zephir way of including a call to a C function directly inside Zephir.

See [pull request #21](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir/pull/21#issuecomment-26178522) on the Zephir repository for more information. Additionally there is some [Optimizer documentation](http://zephir-lang.com/functions.html#using-optimizers) in the Zephir manual pages. My [issue #128](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir/issues/128) provides some additional configuration information missing from other sources.

For information on building Zephir see [their documentation](http://zephir-lang.com/install.html).
