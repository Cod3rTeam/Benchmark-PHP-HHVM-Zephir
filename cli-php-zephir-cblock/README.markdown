Zephir with CBLOCK
==================

This is the simplest way (**not** the best way) of including a call to a C function directly inside Zephir.

See [pull request #21](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir/pull/21) on the Zephir repository for more information.

For information on building Zephir see [their documentation](http://zephir-lang.com/install.html).
